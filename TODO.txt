- Prevent default action for import/export
- Import from CSV
	- read file by chunks
	- convert to JSON
	- upload to server
	- handle ID conflict
	- think about transactionality
- DB security
- Configure DB location and store it in browser storage
- organize import/export links in more usable way
- Clean up installation/start scripts
- Write installation manual
- Status tracking
- Optimize DB queries (e.g. avoid emiting documents)
- Offline mode support

- Sort expenses on the client-side
- Unit tests

Low priority:
- Refactor DateFilterDialog: it should create a link and a dialog as a single component.
- Refactor all dialogs - make sure they are inherited from Dialog
- Scripts for preprocessing DB logic scripts that will allow to upload it without web-interface and write file as plain .js
- Filter expenses by time
	- Add ability to resize dialog
